Sudoku Solver in Python

My first own project to train in python language. 

I want to use here not 100% recursion, but I want to code program, as it would solve sudoku like human. 
It should check possibilities by square ( if there is value in square, it won't be in this square ) and also horizontal / vertical lines ( in same way of thinking.

At the end, where program would be in endless loop , then use recursion to solve it, but with much less possibilities.
